module Sprinkle
  # = Packages
  #
  # A package defines one or more things to provision onto the server.
  # There is a lot of flexibility in a way a package is defined but
  # let me give you a basic example:
  #
  #   package :ruby do
  #     description 'Ruby MRI'
  #     version '1.8.6'
  #     apt 'ruby'
  #
  #     verify { has_executable 'ruby' }
  #   end
  #
  # The above would define a package named 'ruby' and give it a description
  # and explicitly say its version. It is installed via apt and to verify
  # the installation was successful sprinkle will check for the executable
  # 'ruby' being availble. Pretty simple, right?
  #
  # <b>Note:</b> Defining a package does not INSTALL it. To install a
  # package, you must require it in a Sprinkle::Policy block. 
  #
  # == Pre-Requirements
  #
  # Most packages have some sort of pre-requisites in order to be installed.
  # Sprinkle allows you to define the requirements of the package, which
  # will be installed before the package itself. An example below:
  #
  #   package :rubygems do
  #     source 'http://rubyforge.org/rubygems.tgz'
  #     requires :ruby
  #   end
  #
  # In this case, when rubygems is being installed, Sprinkle will first
  # provision the server with Ruby to make sure the requirements are met.
  # In turn, if ruby has requirements, it installs those first, and so on.
  #
  # == Verifications
  #
  # Most of the time its important to know whether the software you're 
  # attempting to install was installed successfully or not. For this,
  # Sprinkle provides verifications. Verifications are one or more blocks
  # which define rules with which Sprinkle can check if it installed
  # the package successfully. If these verification blocks fail, then 
  # Sprinkle will gracefully stop the entire process. An example below:
  #
  #   package :rubygems do
  #     source 'http://rubyforge.org/rubygems.tgz'
  #     requires :ruby
  #
  #     verify { has_executable 'gem' }
  #   end
  #
  # In addition to verifying an installation was successfully, by default
  # Sprinkle runs these verifications <em>before</em> the installation to
  # check if the package is already installed. If the verifications pass
  # before installing the package, it skips the package. To override this
  # behavior, set the -f flag on the sprinkle script or set the
  # :force option to true in Sprinkle::OPTIONS
  #
  # For more information on verifications and to see all the available
  # verifications, see Sprinkle::Verify
  #
  # == Virtual Packages
  #
  # Sometimes, there are multiple packages available for a single task. An
  # example is a database package. It can contain mySQL, postgres, or sqlite!
  # This is where virtual packages come in handy. They are defined as follows:
  #
  #   package :sqlite3, :provides => :database do
  #     apt 'sqlite3'
  #   end
  #
  # The :provides option allows you to reference this package either by :sqlite3
  # or by :database. But whereas the package name is unique, multiple packages may
  # share the same provision. If this is the case, when running Sprinkle, the 
  # script will ask you which provision you want to install. At this time, you
  # can only install one. 
  #
  # == Meta-Packages
  #
  # A package doesn't require an installer. If you want to define a package which
  # merely encompasses other packages, that is fine too. Example:
  #
  #   package :meta do
  #     requires :magic_beans
  #     requires :magic_sauce
  #   end
  #
