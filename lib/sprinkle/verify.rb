module Sprinkle
  # = Verify Blocks
  #
  # As documented in Sprinkle::Package, you may define a block on a package
  # which verifies that a package was installed correctly. If this verification
  # block fails, Sprinkle will stop the script gracefully, raising the error.
  # 
  # In addition to checking post install if it was successfully, verification
  # blocks are also run before an install to see if a package is <em>already</em>
  # installed. If this is the case, the package is skipped and Sprinkle continues
  # with the next package. This behavior can be overriden by setting the -f flag on
  # the sprinkle script or setting Sprinkle::OPTIONS[:force] to true if you're
  # using sprinkle programmatically. 
  #
  # == An Example
  #
  # The following verifies that rails was installed correctly be checking to see
  # if the 'rails' command is available on the command line:
  #
  #   package :rails do
  #     gem 'rails'
  #     
  #     verify do
  #       has_executable 'rails'
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # == Available Verifiers
  #
  # There are a variety of available methods for use in the verification block.
  # The standard methods are defined in the Sprinkle::Verifiers module, so see
  # their corresponding documentation.
  #
  # == Custom Verifiers
  # 
  # If you feel that the built-in verifiers do not offer a certain aspect of
  # verification which you need, you may create your own verifier! Simply wrap
  # any method in a module which you want to use:
  #
  #   module MagicBeansVerifier
  #     def has_magic_beans(sauce)
  #       @commands << '[ -z "`echo $' + sauce + '`"]'
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # The method can append as many commands as it wishes to the @commands array. 
  # These commands will be run on the remote server and <b>MUST</b> give an
  # exit status of 0 if successful or other if unsuccessful.
  #
  # To register your verifier, call the register method on Sprinkle::Verify:
  #
  #   Sprinkle::Verify.register(MagicBeansVerifier)
  #
  # And now you may use it like any other verifier:
  #
  #   package :magic_beans do
  #     gem 'magic_beans'
  #     
  #     verify { has_magic_beans('ranch') }
  #   end
