    # This actor implementation performs any given commands on your local system, as
    # opposed to other implementations that generally run commands on a remote system
    # via the network.
    #
    # This is useful if you'd like to use Sprinkle to provision your local machine. 
    # To enable this actor, in your Sprinkle script specify the :local delivery mechanism.
